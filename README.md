Your local crime tracker around Denver, Colorado. Be active. Be safe.

# Application Details

## Purpose

CrimeAde is a mobile-friendly app that allows a user to be more aware of the crimes around them. It also lets a user enter a crime by its crime type followed by where it happened at and telling other users of these crimes. A user's crime-warning message stays anonymous so no one will know who reported it that way snitches won't end up in stitches. However, if a user just wants to view the crimes in their local area, they can navigate to the type of crime that occurred based on the reportings. ****

## Future Development

The future development plans for crimeAde is to incorporate a log in page so that random users won't be able to delete other user's crime entry. It'll also have a real-time chat feature that others can message and interact with each other. This will be handy so that a user wont have to constantly refresh their server to see new messages and to stay aware of their surroundings. ****
