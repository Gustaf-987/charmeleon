# Application Details

## Purpose

CrimeAde is a mobile-friendly app that allows a user to be more aware of the crimes around them. Our goal is to help users be safe by becoming more informed. 

## Description
Our app lets users view crime data for each state from the FBI on a google map, as well as local, location-based crime data for the Denver area. Additionally, users may enter their own data if they were a victim of a crime. For security reasons, all user data is kept anonymous. Since our goal is to help users be safe, our app provides randomized safety tips on each reload, as well as local emergency numbers. Currently our local and user data side focuses on users in the Denver area.

## Future Development
